## Resource use

For each mRS, the number of each of the following can be calculated:
+ A&E admissions
+ NEL bed days
+ EL bed days 
+ Residential care 

These are calculated separately for discounted and undiscounted. (Whatever they are??)



### Resource use models

For a given individual and a number of years, the total number of A&E admissions, elective bed days, and non-elective bed days can be calculated.

The method is broadly similar for each (comments from the R code):
  1. _"calculates the normalized age"_
  2. _"calculates the linear predictor for EL bed days"_
  3. _"creates the lambda function for the equation"_
  4. _"equation that estimates the EL bed days count"_
  
And each of the three models uses a separate set of coefficients (constant, age, sex, gamma) and a different weight for each mRS.

> One of these variables is called "gamma". Is it related to the gamma for the Gompertz mortality function? 

+ A&E admissions model:
$$ 
\mathrm{Count} = 
  \exp{( 
    \gamma_{\mathrm{AE}} \times LP_{\mathrm{AE}}
    \times 
    \mathrm{yrs} ^{\gamma_{\mathrm{AE}}}
  )}
$$
Weibull distribution.


+ Elective bed days model:
$$ 
  \mathrm{Count} = 
    -\log{\left( 
      \frac{1}{
        1+ [\mathrm{yrs}*\exp{(-LP_\mathrm{EL})} ] ^{1/ \gamma_{\mathrm{EL}}} 
      }
    \right)}
$$
Log-logistic distribution.

+ Non-elective bed days model:
$$ 
  \mathrm{Count} = 
    -\log{\left( 
      \frac{1}{
        1+ [\mathrm{yrs}*\exp{(-LP_\mathrm{NEL})} ] ^{1/ \gamma_{\mathrm{NEL}}} 
      }
    \right)}
$$
Log-logistic distribution. 

Then the calculated numbers of days are multiplied by the cost of each day or cost of each trip to A&E to give the total cost of resource use. 

Notes: 
+ Log-logistic function = log of a logistic distribution.
